        <p class="p1">
          &emsp;&emsp;Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel (Gujarat: 31 October 1875 –
          15 December 1950), commonly known as Sardar Vallabhai Patel, was an
          Indian independence nationalist and barrister who served as the first
          Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947 to 1950. He
          was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a
          significant role in the country's struggle for independence and its
          political integration. In India and elsewhere, he was often called
          Sardar, meaning "Chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted
          as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the
          Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.

            The Vallabhbhai Patel memorial is located on the ground floor,
            covering the central hall and four adjacent rooms. The central hall
            is filled with portraits of Patel, his family, friends and
            colleagues in the Indian freedom struggle. They are in chronological
            order and with biographical descriptions of periods of his life, and
            quotes by his colleagues and admirers. Two of the four adjacent
            rooms house relics of Patel's life, his personal possessions as well
            as displayed accounts and political cartoons from newspapers of the
            time. One room is devoted to a particular phase of Patel's work -
            his comradeship with Mohandas Gandhi in the 1930s, his youth,
            education and legal career, and his work as India's home minister in
            integrating princely states into India. In a room to the right of
            the main entrance into the palace, is where Patel's personal effects
            are on display. These include his khadi kurta, jacket and dhoti, his
            shoes, slippers and European-style clothes from his younger days.
            Also on display is a flag of India as created by the Indian National
            Congress in 1930-31
